# Growing with tech --> Growing tech
Data visualization project for IS219 - Advanced Web Dev. Here I'll be exploring the influence of technology on degree choices.

- Essential question - Are those who grew up with a heavy technology presence (gen z) more likely to persue STEM degrees?
- Data sources - From Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, "Number and percentage distribution of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degrees/certificates conferred by postsecondary institutions, by race/ ethnicity, level of degree/certificate, and sex of student: Academic years 2011-12 through 2020-21". Record of degrees awarded by postsecondary institutions from 2011-2021, a period of time where a good chunk of gen z graduated college.
- Thoughts on visualization approaches - time series showing trends of various conferred STEM degrees, highlighting what major tech advances were made when the graduating class growing up. Maybe add a line of conferred non-STEM degrees to show scale of popularity of STEM degrees. Could also have a bar chart showing distribution of degrees over vaious years to show change in proportion of degrees. This is planned to show that people aren't just getting more STEM degrees, but are avoiding non-STEM degrees.
