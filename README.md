# Growing with tech --> Growing tech
Data visualization project for IS219 - Advanced Web Dev. Here I'll be exploring the influence of technology on degree choices.

- Essential question - Are those who grew up with a heavy technology presence (gen z) more likely to persue STEM degrees?
- Data sources - From Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, "Number and percentage distribution of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) degrees/certificates conferred by postsecondary institutions, by race/ ethnicity, level of degree/certificate, and sex of student: Academic years 2011-12 through 2020-21". Record of degrees awarded by postsecondary institutions from 2011-2021, a period of time where a good chunk of gen z graduated college.
- Thoughts on visualization approaches - chart showing trends of various conferred STEM degrees, highlighting what major tech advances were made when the graduating class growing up. maybe add a line of conferred non-STEM degrees to show scale of popularity of STEM degrees.
